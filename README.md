Agree on the naming convention
There are many different naming conventions for CSS. The most popular ones are BEM, SMACSS, and OOCSS, to name just a few. If your team decides to adapt to the naming convention, every developer should understand the structure of the component. The code would feel like it is written by a single person, which would improve readability. Additionally, isolating CSS naming convention from JS naming convention is always a good idea.

Define coding rules
Coding rules should include decisions about defining global styles, variables, mixins, functions and more. These coding rules could be about anything, from typography to unit usage.
