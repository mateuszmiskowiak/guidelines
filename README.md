# guidelines
Typescript:
- Type cast should be done with as syntax
- Do not set the type of initialized variables which type is inferred for its value
- Do not set the type of parameters with a default value which type is inferred for its value
- Do not use any, use a new type to be assigned to the value
- Use type over interface for new types
